## Project description

In the world of smart home replenishment, most of the solutions are lacking specific functionalities. [Dash buttons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Dash) for example are not really measuring the exact needs of the customer. If you place the dash button near your toothpaste and click it as soon as the toothpaste runs emtpy, well, then you will need to wait for the package to arrive to refill your toothpaste. On the other hand smart solutions like the smart HP ink printer ([Instant Ink](https://www.hp.com/de-de/shop/offer.aspx?p=instantink)) and the smart washing machine from Hoover are measuring the exact needs of the customer through constant monitoring of the washing powder or ink. However, in this case a customer needs two systems for two products. This does not scale well at all with adding more smart products to the household.

To provide a single platform for many smart home appliances, Amazon launched the [Amazon Dash Replenishment Service](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/dash-services). This service allows manufacturers to use the Amazon APIs to make their products smart by monitoring the actual needs of the customer. In that way reorders happen automatically when the appliance runs low. However, with this solution manufacturers are very dependant on Amazon. Amazon serves as a single source of truth for all manufacturers and their data. So in the end Amazon will have knowledge of all the reorders that happen within the system.

This project aims to provide a decentralised solution to manufacturers which means the middleman like Amazon will be omitted. This means that the manufacturers will have direct contact to the customers and their data. With that the system provides more data democracy to the manufacturers. Also, the dependency between manufacturers and a potential middleman can be omitted, saving costs in term of contractual fees.
